# Matt Baier — Personal Resume Site

This site started as a plain resume and evolved into a living demonstration of:
- system thinking
- personality and humor
- real-world operational discipline
- front-end control and UI polish
- turning chaos into something smooth

It's equal parts professional portfolio and personal calling card.

### What’s Inside

- Clean resume layout with warm paper aesthetic  
- Animated theme toggle switching between:
  - **Spartan Mode** (green)
  - **Wolverine Mode** (maize & blue)
- Button shake animation on click
- Glowing "Tech-Enabled Growth" tagline
- Custom color palette, accented border, subtle shadow
- Footer signature: `[ matt 🐻 bear ]`

> If someone can manage a kitchen rush and animate a theme button, they can probably manage your workflows too.
