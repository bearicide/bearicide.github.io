# Matt Baier — A Personal Website and Journey

This site started as a plain resume and evolved into a living demonstration of:
- systematuc thinking
- personality and humor
- real-world operational discipline
- front-end control and UI polish
- turning chaos into something smooth
- proof of dedication and willingness to adapt
- a showcase of some fun stuff
- a reason to make hyphenated lists

It's equal parts professional portfolio and personal calling card. Text only, please.

### What’s Inside (That's what counts...right?)

- Clean resume layout with warm paper aesthetic  
- Animated theme toggle switching between:
  - **Spartan Mode** (green)
  - **Wolverine Mode** (maize & blue)
- Button shake animation on click
- Glowing "Tech-Enabled Growth" tagline
- Custom color palette, accented border, subtle shadow
- Footer signature: `[ matt 🐻 bear ]`

> If someone can manage a kitchen rush and animate a theme button, they can probably manage your workflows too.
